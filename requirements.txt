# Core scientific and data manipulation libraries
numpy               # For numerical operations, arrays, and matrices
pandas              # For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation

# System and string handling (standard libraries, included in Python)
# os                # For file and directory management
# string            # For string constants and operations
# re                # For regular expressions

# Visualization libraries
matplotlib          # For plotting and visualizations
seaborn             # For statistical data visualization built on top of matplotlib

# Machine Learning utilities
scikit-learn        # For model selection, data shuffling, and metrics

# Deep Learning (for sequence-to-sequence translation models)
tensorflow          # Backend engine for Keras (includes Keras in recent versions)
keras               # High-level neural network API used for defining the translation model

# Jupyter Notebook magic (not needed in requirements)
# %matplotlib inline  # Ensures inline plot rendering in notebooks
